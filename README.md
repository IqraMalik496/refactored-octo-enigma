# refactored-octo-enigma
I am doing research on host-pathogen protien interaction networks using computational approaches.
 i am reading a lot more stuff from previous few months.
and trust me i was null when started it.
i have a computer science background.
working with protiens is different and having initial knowledge of protien sequences takes much of my time.
Right now, i have got a path but still i'll need some one supervision who is willing to assist my work.
I really want to go on with some one from whom i can discuss my work, to know whether i am going on a right path.
I mean, extracting correct data from online databases are difficult task for me actually. because i have basic knowledge about this field.
i know the word supervision will make no sense, i need only one or maybe two times help for start up.
Thanks
